<h1>Doing what you must</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
You;ve seen the movies. You've read about it. You know what a zombie bite does.
You realize that it's inevitable that you're going to turn into a flesh eating
zombie. You realize your only choice is to shoot yourself before it's too late.
You muster whatever strength you have to pull out the gun from your back pocket
and you shoot yourself for the safety of all humankind. The end.
