<h1>Going into bedroom</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
You open the door to the bedroom and you can barely hold back your screams. There's
blood everywhere. There's a person hanging from the ceiling covered in a bloody sheet.
There's bloody footprints leading into the closet. There's bloody handprints on
the window sill. The window is open. You feel like you're being watched. There's a
bed that looks like it's been moved around the room. What would you like to do?
