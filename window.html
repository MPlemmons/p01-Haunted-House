<h1>Look out the window</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
As you approach the window, a cold gust of wind comes from the window. Brrr it's
cold. You poke your head out the window and don't see anything out of the ordinary.
You shut the window and latch it. You turn around around and there's a ghostly
image standing before you. Before you can make out what's going on, the window
flies open and the ghost pushes you out the window. As you fall to your dead, you
start to wonder why yuo crawled out of bed. The end.
