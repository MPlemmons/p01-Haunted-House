<h1>Petting puppy</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
As you reach your hand out to pet the puppy. The puppy turns and stares at you
with red eyes and growling teeth. you look in the dish and notice there's a bloody
human arm that's been gnawed on. You back away to try to make it to the exit, but
it's too late. The puppy runs at you and bites your leg. You fall over and try to
crawl, but the puppy jumps to the other side of you and bites you ear off. Then,
it starts knawing at the rest of your face. You're dead. The end.
