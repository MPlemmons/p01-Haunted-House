<h1>Under the bed</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
As you are about to check under a bed, it moves. You back away from the bed scared
out of your mind. You slowly approach the bed again and lift up the sheets to peer
under the bed. Wow, there's nothing under there except for an innocent looking
doll. You stand up and the bed moves another inch or so. Woh what's oing on here.
You look under the bed again and the doll has moved as well. It's looking right
at you. All of a suddent, it starts crawling towards you. You stand up and start
backing away from the bed. The doll comes out from underneath the bed and starts
running towards you. You turn around and start to run, but the doll's too fast and
jumps on your back. You fight with it as it's got its little hands around your
neck. You finally pull it off of you and fling it out the open window. Man, that was
weird. What would you like to do?
