<h1>On your way home</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
You decide to turn around and go home. As you continue you way back down the path,
you hear a growling. All of a sudden, a wolf jumps out of the woods showing his
teeth. It's blocking your path so you can't continue the path home. You have no
choice, except to run back towards the scary mansion. You start sprinting back to the
mansion with the snarling wolf on your tail. As you approach the gigantic mansion
overlooking you, you run in the gate and shut it behind you. Whew! You're safe
from the wolf. Now that you're in the yard what would you like to do?
