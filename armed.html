<h1>Approach house....finally</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
You approach the house. As you walk by the tomb stones a zombie climbs out of
the ground and trips you. You drop the shovel. Now you know the use of the shovel.
You pick it back up and with one mighty swing you hit the zombie in the head and
knock its head off. The zombie collapses on the ground. Finally, a sigh of relief.
With the zombie dead, you walk up the steps of the house. There is a rusty door
knocker. the door knob is rusty also. It looks to be stained in blood as well. It
doesn't look like anyone's home.
What would you like to do?
