<h1>In the closet</h1>

<p>
As you approach the closet, you can't help but feel like you are being watched.
You grab the handle of the closet door and open it. There's nothing in there except
for clothes. You shuffle through the clothes just to make sure. All of a sudden a
hand comes out of the sleeve of one of the shirts. You let out a loud scream and
the hand grabs you by the throat. A ghoulish head pop out of the shirt and stares
at you with red hypnotizing eyes. You continue to try to break free with no luck.
It has quite the hold on you. Then what looks like a door opens up on the wall at
the back of the closet. Big glaring eyes look at you from the doorway. All of a sudden,
it gets really windy in here. It's coming from the doorway. The wind pulls you through
the doorway and everything goes black. The end,
