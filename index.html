It's cold and dark outside, yet you decide to take a walk. You find a path rarely
traveled and decide to follow it. At the end of the path is a spooky gate and an
old mansion staring down at you. In the front yard is a graveyard with tombstones
sticking out of the ground. What would you like to do?
