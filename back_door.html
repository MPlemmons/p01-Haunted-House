<h1>Trying back door.</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>
You grab the dorknob to the back door and turn it in with ease. As you push on it,
it doesn't budge. As you peer out the window, you notice the door's been nailed
shut from the outside. That's weird. Wondering what they were trying to keep in.
What would you like to do?
